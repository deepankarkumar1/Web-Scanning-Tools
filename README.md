- **Nmap** – Network exploration and security auditing.
- **Wapiti** – Web application vulnerability scanner.
- **Nikto** – Web server scanner to detect potential issues.
- **Nuclei** – Fast and customizable vulnerability scanner.
- **Dirsearch** – Command-line directory and file brute-forcing tool.
- **Dirb** – Directory scanner for web servers.
- **TestSSL** – SSL/TLS configuration tester for servers.
- **Sqlmap** – SQL Injection vulnerability scanner.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Scan web servers for a wide range of vulnerabilities.
- 🧰 Combine multiple scanning tools in one workflow.
- 📊 Generate consolidated reports (WIP or manually analyzed).
- ⚙️ Custom scanning options for fine-tuned analysis.
- ✅ Auto-install required tools (optional pre-check script).

---

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepankarkumar1/web-scanning-tools.git
cd web-scanning-tools
````

### 2. Make scripts executable

```bash
chmod +x check-and-install-tools.sh
chmod +x scan-tools.sh
```

---

## ⚙️ Usage

### 🔄 Recommended: Install all required tools first

```bash
./check-and-install-tools.sh
```

This script checks and installs all necessary dependencies and tools before scanning.

### 🚀 Run the scanning tools

If all dependencies are already installed:

```bash
./scan-tools.sh <target-url>
```

Example:

```bash
./scan-tools.sh https://example.com
```

## 📌 Notes

* Ensure you have root privileges for tools like Nmap or Sqlmap when needed.
* Use responsibly: Only scan applications and servers you **own** or have **explicit permission** to test.
* Some tools may require Python 3 or additional system packages (e.g., `pip`, `nmap`, `go`, etc.).
* Customize `scan-tools.sh` as needed to control which tools run and how.
